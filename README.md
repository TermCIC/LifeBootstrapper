# LifeBootstrapper

LifeBootstrapper is a program to generate expected values of life table parameters based on:
(1) a survival/day dataset
(2) a fecundity/day dataset
(3) sex ratio of the subject insect species

The program will generate expected values of life table parameters by creating random insects based on these datasets,
then calculate following parameters with bootstrap technique:

## Population doubling time (Dt)


## Be cautiaus
(1) The parameters generated by this program represent expected values and should be used for comparison with parameters derived from actual cohort data.
(2) The parameters generated by this program is based on random generated insects with following assumptions:
    (a) For each insect, early life history has no impact on its later life stages.
    (b) Instar and stage have no impacts on life.
    (c) Sex has no impacts on survival, only effect on fecundity.

## Why use this program?
With these assumptions, the life table parameters generated can be used for examination on the impacts of early life history, instar and stage, and sex.
